# Python_SQLAlchemy_Project
Lab 4c for COMP 353 to create dynamic web content based off database values

## How to

### Prerequisites

- Your system must have MySQL or Mariadb running as a system process (and you must know the credentials to log in to it)
- Your system must have Python installed with the following pip packages:
  - Flask
  - Flask-WTF
  - Flask-MySQLdb
  - Flask-SQLAlchemy
  - mysql
  - mysql-connector-python

### Setup

- Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/Jkotheimer/Python_SQLAlchemy_Project`
- Move into the project directory: `cd Python_SQLAlchemy_Project`
- Create the database: `./exec_sql.sh` (this script also takes .sql files as a parameter to execute)
  - (Optional) Add test values into the database: `./exec_sql.sh sql/test_insertions.sql`
- Start the server: `python run.py`
- Visit the webpage at http://localhost:5000

### Developer info

- flask_app/routes.py
  - `/` & `/home`: The home page of the site - displays all projects and employees who work on them
  - `/about`: A general info page (not implemented)
  - `/assign`: A form to select an employee and a project from drop down boxes, assigning the employee to the given project
  - `/employees`: Display all employees and present a form to add a new employee
  - `/employees/<ssn>`: Get all info about the employee with the specified social security number
  - `/projects`: Display all projects and who is working on them
  - `/projects/<ID>`: Get all info about the project with the specified ID number
  
- flask_app/models.py
  - A Flask Pythonic class representation of the database created at sql/create_db.sql

- flask_app/forms.py
  - AssignForm: Grabs all Employees and projects and places them into drop boxes
  - RemovalForm: Grabs all info from a specified SSN or ProjectID and puts them into radio boxes
  - EmployeeForm: String fields to create a new employee with a SSN and a name
  - ProjectForm: String field to create a new project with a name
  
- flask_app/\__init\__.py
  - Connects the credentials imported from sql_config.py (which is generated by exec_sql.sh) to your local MySQL database
  - Glues together all of the above peices into the main app and serves it with Flask
